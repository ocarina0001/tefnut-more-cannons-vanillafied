converting from amc to mcv, we can;
- probably scrap all those damage defs, not really useful
- move designation into security
- trim research down to 3
- remove all items, this is an CANNON mod
- remove cnc stuff, merge ammo into machining table / fabricator
- simplify cannons
- simplify ammo
- fall in line with vanilla practices and standards
- add automated cannons

in terms of CE, push onto github and wait for someone who knows about CE to build for it
